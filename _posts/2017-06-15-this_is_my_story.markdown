Everyone has a story. And this is mine.

I grew up in Southern India with a penchant for all things nerdy - books, math, physics, chemistry and computer science. While everyone - family, friends (even neighbours!) - rooted for me to pursue computer science engineering at the university, there I was wanting to do "something different" and not what was expected of me. 

So while my high school classmates joined various streams of engineering, I began pouring over law texts and gearing up for law school - because I am different, no?

Five years at law school, five years as a tax attorney and litigator at a law firm, one masters degree in international taxation, three years as a tax manager at a Big Four firm in New York later, I realized that I wanted to do "something different" again. Not just conform to what's expected. I wanted to further develop an old skill and what better than pursuing something that I already knew and loved. 

So here I am, on a quest to do "something different",  because I am me and I dont let anybody tell me otherwise. #girlpower.
