I couldn't be more excited about my react app, which is also the final project requirement for the learn curriculum! 

For my final project - I chose to build a book tracker. The app has a react front end and connects to Google Books API . The user can search for books using the Google Books API and save books to a watchlist, which is built using a Rails backend.
