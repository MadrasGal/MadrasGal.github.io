So here I am feeling really good after writing my first blog post on how I wanted to do #somethingdifferent and #girlpower. I powered through the first few sections of the curriculum with a feeling of - I got this - and better still - I got this all wrapped up around my finger. And along comes self-doubt. 

Am I doing the right thing? Is it worth it? Should I be investing this time learning to code when I could be on my way to a more senior level at a Big Four firm? I've spent so many years developing my skill as a tax consultant, do I want to let it all go? What is it that I really want from life? Can I sustain this? Again, am I doing the right thing?

A zillion thoughts in my head, each more confusing than the other, but neither making anything easier for me. I was weighed down, confused and simply stressed with this kind of circular thinking. 

I stopped working on my course because I wasn't sure if this was the right thing to do, and not working on the course stressed me out because now I was way behind schedule. It was a loop and I had to find a way to break it. 

I had a conversation with my piano teacher and what he said just cleared it all up for me. In essence, he said this: there will always be challenges (often psychological) that will come your way, deterring you from focusing on what you need to focus. There will be people telling you why you should or should not be doing something. Psychological battles that question just about everything. Most successful people have been through this and the key to getting out of an unending loop is to just  break, to set aside all those thoughts and simply focus on what needs to be done.

I started writing - using a pencil and a paper (yes those things still exist in today's tech world!) - just about everything. My thoughts, my fears, my ambition - I wrote it all. and then it came back to me - I was different, no? I can do this. And I believe I can do this really well.
