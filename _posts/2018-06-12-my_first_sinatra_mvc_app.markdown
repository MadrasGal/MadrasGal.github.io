I am really excited about this new app! I am a dog lover and huge advocate of dog rescue and adoption. This sinatra app aims to create an app for dog shelters to be able to track the dogs in their care and the adoption status.

The user would be able to create an account/login to the portal and view the list of dogs available in the care of the shelter, information about the dog such as name, age, breed, adoption status etc. The user would also be able to update the information as required and if required, delete the dog from the database.

This app is really the first step to creating a comprehensive software that will help many rescue organizations streamline the adoption process and manage/track dogs in their care. I am excited about this idea and hope to  be able to add a number of features such as - foster tracking etc.
