This past project, I worked on adding Javascript to my Rails Project. Here are some of the features that I've added to my Rails app:

1. Append Reserved workspaces to User's show page
2. View existing locations in a sequential order by adding a Next Button
3. Using Rails API and a form to create a new building resource and render the response without a page refresh
