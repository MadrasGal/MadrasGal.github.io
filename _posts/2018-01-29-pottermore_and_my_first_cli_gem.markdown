SO. I've finally made it through the end of OO ruby - a lot of huffing and puffing to get here but yes, I've made it and I'm really excited to share more about my first CLI gem! 

Welcome to Pottermore -- your one source for the latest in the wizarding world. Don't worry, if you haven't got your letter to Hogwarts as yet, keep reading the Daily Prophet for the latest news (using ths [magical gem](https://github.com/MadrasGal/purnima-cli-app) of course!) and your owl might arrive very soon! 

This [magical gem](https://github.com/MadrasGal/purnima-cli-app) provides a list of the latest Harry Potter news with an option to read any of the items  in more detail.  Some screenshots from the cli app are as follows:

I intend to work more on this gem to add new features - such as shopping (Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes anyone?), and possibly a sorting hat too for the developer wizards and witches out there! Stay tuned!
